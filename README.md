# TeamFonz
Group Project to practice using JavaScript/ Java to make a web based Professional Development Award (PDA) Submission application app.

Created during Week 15 of CodeClan. 

## TeamFonz consisted of 
- Genna Walsh (genocw)
- Graham Stein (Graham-Stein)
- Kris Mac (krismac)

We agreed that there was a opportunity for a PDA submission app. 

The website should take in some input, and display the breakdown of the data in a graph.

##Specification
CodeClan instructors required that we establish a project to create an application in 5 days using core Javascript with the frameworks. 

Our trello/kanban dynamically compared our MoSCoW requirements with our backlog/work breakdown status.

# Development
We self organised around 4 sprints, focusing on particular features and functionality within the days. The days were kicked off with a stand-up to support retrospective and re-planning and closed our day with a huddle and code remerges. We took turns in being Scrum Master each day and regularly took turns to drive. 

Our first exercise involved a short burst of independent research followed by a brainstorming session to determine core functionality (MVP) and data sources/approaches. The remainder of sprint 1 involved agreeing user journey/requirements and work breakdown along with laying groundwork such as creating a workflow to support code management around Github.
